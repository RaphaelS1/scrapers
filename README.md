# scrapers

This repo contains a couple of useful scrapers using Beautiful Soup in Python.

mpsontwitter_scraper scrapes the total number of interactions (likes + retweets) from all UK MP tweets in a given data range. Results can be viewed either per tweet or aggregated over each MP. (Run-time for the year 2016 is approx 6 hours).

nips_scraper scrapes the titles and abstracts of every NIPS paper published in a given year, as well as downloading the papers as pdfs.
